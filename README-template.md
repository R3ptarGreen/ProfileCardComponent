## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How to use de sintax cal() to calculate the center in a especific object

```css
.card_header .victor{
    position: absolute;
    top: calc(180px - 48px);
    left: calc(200px - 48px);
    border-radius: 50%;
    border: 5px solid white;
}
```

### Continued development

I want continued development in grid display and use another sintax in CSS to make website more dinamics

### Useful resources

- [CSS generator Tool](https://cssgenerator.org/) - This page can help you how to make a shadow box in CSS.
